# Cloud Vendor Information Service â€“ Spring Boot RESTful API with CRUD Operations

I have created this project to gain hands on experience on how to build RESTful APIs using Java Spring Boot**.
I have developed a backend application that supports **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to manage cloud vendor information. All APIs have been tested using **Postman** to ensure they work as expected.

## What I Have Developed in This Project

- I have built a **Spring Boot application** from scratch using Spring Initializer.  
- I have implemented **CRUD operations** for managing Cloud Vendor Information via RESTful APIs.  
- I have used **key Spring Boot annotations** including:  
  - `@SpringBootApplication`  
  - `@RestController`  
  - `@RequestBody`  
  - `@RequestMapping`  
  - `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, `@DeleteMapping`  
- I have ensured **JSON** as the default data exchange format.  
- I have tested all endpoints using **Postman**.
